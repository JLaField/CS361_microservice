Microservice for Daniel's portfolio project

To request data, call the API with a HTTP GET request. For example, GET localhost:3000/medical.

You will then receive the data through the HTTP response, in the form of JSON objects. 
In this example, you will receive all objects relating to organizations who have a category of medical.
